# Introduction to Database

Welcome to the introduction to database course!

We will start the course by learning what is *Relational Database* and dive into
the detail of concrete database like MySQL.

Later on in the course, we will, then, go over the advance yet central topic of
*Relational Database* -- Joins. Of course, with a lot of examples to practice
JOINs.

After we are done with *Relational Database*, we will go over the NoSQL database
such as MongoDB to get a hands on difference between Relational Database and
NoSQL database.

All in all after the class, you should be able to read/write code to
read/store/manipulate data into database.

## Prerequisites

As this course is 100 level courses, I do not expect any of you to have any
programming background before hands. Thus, the course will assume you know
nothing and teach everything from ground up.

Although it is not required but please be familiar with terminal (Command line
interface on windows). Most of the examples within lectures will be in terminal.

> While some may be in the MySQL workbench, I'd prefer to do everything in terminal

I do recommend you to have a programming text-editor ready like
[Sublime Text][sublime], [Atom][atom] or [Visual Studio Code][vscode] installed on your
computer so you can code well.
